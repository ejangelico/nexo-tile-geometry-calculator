The process of converting strips from shapely objects to DXF is pretty stupid... 

1. Get the "tile" object that you want to export.
2. call tile.export_strips(filetag) with filetag having no extension
3. This will create ~10 files, with the end result being a .dxf, separate files for x and y strips
4. Import this .dxf into Solidworks with units of millimeters
5. Right click the imported model and go "Make edit sketch"
6. Boss extrude the sketch to any value.
7. Shift-click select all of the top surfaces of the strips
8. Right-click and "Export to DXF/DFW", save with a tag that denotes it as "processed"
9. This file is now importable to comsol with the "Geometry Import" function, with the import objects being "Curves, edges, and points" as opposed to solids and surfaces.
